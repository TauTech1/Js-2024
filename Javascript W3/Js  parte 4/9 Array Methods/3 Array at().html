<h1>JavaScript Arrays</h1>
<h2>The at() Method</h2>

<p>The at() method returns an indexed element from an array:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];


document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.at(-1);
</script>
<p>
    Note
Many languages allows negative bracket indexing like [-1] to access elements from the end of an object / array / string.

This is not possible in JavaScript, because [] is used for accessing both arrays and objects. obj[-1] refers to the value of key -1, not to the last property of the object.

The at() method was introduced in ES2022 to solve this problem.
