    <h2>The join() Method</h2>

    <p>The join() method joins array elements into a string.</p>
    <p>It this example we have used " * " as a separator between the elements:</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.join(" + ");
    </script>
    <p>The join() method also joins all array elements into a string.

        It behaves just like toString(), but in addition you can specify the separator:</p>
